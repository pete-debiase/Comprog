# LeetCode
Many devs bemoan the fact that technical interviews are so focused on quasi-esoteric LeetCode-style data structures and algorithms coding problems, but I think it's great. How wonderful to have such a big component of interviewing be such a well-defined little minigame :) .

Also, I LOVE quasi-esoteric pursuits like LeetCode, with Japanese and stenography being two of my other favorites!

My (tentative) goal is to complete ALL of the LeetCode problems (2142 as of 2022/01/18).
